DTGov Demos: Release Workflow
-----------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

This demo shows how DTGov can start a Project Workflow via a simple Maven build.  
This demo contains two projects:

* project: a very simple maven module with artifactId of "project".
* service: a maven module containing the Hello World Service API, expressed in WSDL.

The goal is to show that an upload of a pom.xml with artifactId of "project" 
kicks of a workflow of type overlord.demo.SimpleReleaseProcess.png.

How It Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying the 'artifacts' JAR to S-RAMP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get this demo working you must be running the DTGov server and the S-RAMP repository (see documentation 
for the DTGov and S-RAMP projects to learn how to run the S-RAMP repository).

The first step is to build and deploy all artifacts to S-RAMP using Maven.
The demo is configured to run against the default security settings found in
the distribution.  If you change the security configuration you may need to set the 
username and password when running the demo.  You can use the following -D properties:

* sramp.auth.username - sets the BASIC auth username to use during the demo
* sramp.auth.password - sets the BASIC auth password to use during the demo
....
$ mvn -Pdemo clean deploy
....

That will enable the 'demo' profile, which will configure the Maven **distributionManagement** to
point to a local S-RAMP repository (http://localhost:8080/s-ramp-server/).  Therefore you need to
be running S-RAMP on port 8080 and deployed as the 's-ramp-atom' context.

The build should complete successfully.

At this point there should be a number of artifacts stored in the S-RAMP repository.  You can verify
that by deploying the "s-ramp-ui" project and then navigating to http://localhost:8080/s-ramp-ui (or
the appropriate URL for you).

You should see the following artifacts in the S-RAMP repository:

* dtgov-demos-switchyard-VERSION.jar

when looking at the details for the project-VERSION.pom you should see that it contains
a custom property of 'maven.artifactId:project'. And with the query defined in the 
dtgov.properties:
....
governance.queries=/s-ramp/ext/SwitchYardApplication|overlord.demo.SimpleReleaseProcess|DeploymentUrl={governance.url}/rest/deploy/{target}/{uuid}::NotificationUrl={governance.url}/rest/notify/email/{group}/deployed/{target}/{uuid}::UpdateMetaDataUrl={governance.url}/rest/update/{name}/{value}/{uuid}::DTGovUrl={dtgov.ui.url}
....
it will start a ProjectLifeCycle workflow when a MavenPom with artifactId of 'pom'
lands in the repository. You should see another custom property getting created which should
look similar to 
....
workflowProcessId=overlord.demo.SimpleReleaseProcess_0:workflowParameters=DeploymentUrl=http://localhost:8080/dtgov/res...
....

Note that the definition of the 'overlord.demo.SimpleReleaseProcess' lives in the
SRAMPPackage in the dtgov-workflow.jar. If you want to update the workflow you
need to use eclipse tooling to modify the bpmn, build and upload a new dtgov-worflow.jar
to S-RAMP. The GAV settings are defined in the dtgov.properties file.

TODO: take the user through the motions of notification, signoff with taskmanagement and deploy.
